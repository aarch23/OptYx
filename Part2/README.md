# __OptyX: Binomial Option Pricing Tree__

Future advancements for OptyX include implementation of a Binomial Pricing Model. The code within this folder is an example of the Binomial Model to be deployed.

The OptyX machine learning process produces unique probabilities for each target outcome. By using these probabilities, OptyX technology is able to extract the risk/reward of the contract at each upward/downward movement in the underlying asset.

Using this model will allow the user to understand how the contract prices behave and respond accordingly. For example, risk/reward values may change to a point where some exposure needs to be reduced or added to support the user's strategy. 

Pictured here is an example of the Binomial Option Pricing Tree:

## __OptyX: Binomial Option Pricing Tree 

The proprietary OptyX technology will use a Binomial Pricing Model for the next step of this project.

The code in this folder is an example of what the Binomial Model which will be deployed in our later development. 
Our machine learninng process produces unique probabilities to each target outcome. 
By using these probabilities we will understand the R/R of the contract at each upward/downward move in the underlying. 
Using this model will allow the user to understand how the contract prices behave, and when R/R values change to a point where some exposure needs to be reduced/ added to support the strategy.
